# variables can be used for all types of things.
# Here we use one to save my name
my_name = 'Chris'
# and another to save my age
my_age = 27

# and if I want to see what those are, I can print them out
print('test')
print('My name is: ')
print(my_name)
print('My age is: ')
print(my_age)

# as another example, say you have math homework for practicing addition
# you can write a program to see if you got the right answers!
number1 = 7
number2 = 4

print('7 multiplied by 4 = ')
print(number1 * number2)
